# Dataset for "Enriching the Metadata of Community-Generated Digital Content through Entity Linking: An Evaluative Comparison of State-of-the-Art Models"

## Overview
This repo contains a historical and cultural narratives text annotated with Named Entity Linking (NER) and  Entity Linking (EL). The dataset consists of 100 annotation (.ann) output files generated using the Brat annotation tool. These annotations were applied to 100 items collected with an equal distribution of 50 items each collected from Morrab Library ([https://morrablibrary.org.uk/](https://morrablibrary.org.uk/)) and The People's Collection of Wales (PCW) ([https://www.peoplescollection.wales/](https://www.peoplescollection.wales/)).

## Dataset Description
- **Annotations**: Each annotation file corresponds to an item and starts with either the collection name ("morrab" or "pcw") followed by an underscore and the item ID.
- **Original Items**: The original items can be retrieved from the respective websites:
  - Morrab Library: [https://photoarchive.morrablibrary.org.uk/items/show/](https://photoarchive.morrablibrary.org.uk/items/show/)
  - The People's Collection of Wales (PCW): [https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/](https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/)

## Original Content Structure
The annotated text was generated by combining the English titles and descriptions of each item, using a carriage return between them.

## Usage
Researchers and practitioners can utilise this dataset for further testing and evaluation of Entity Linking models on historical and cultural narratives. It provides a curated set of annotations that can serve as a benchmark for assessing EL model performance.
